## Data Set Information

* Experiment data was collected from a group of 30 volunteers within an age group of 19-48 years.

* Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

* Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration (X,Y and Z) and 3-axial angular velocity (X,Y and Z) at a constant rate of 50Hz was collected.

* The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually.

* The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
